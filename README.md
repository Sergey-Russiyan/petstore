# REST API testing with Serenity and Cucumber 4

This project show you how to test petstore with REST-API testing using Serenity and Cucumber 4. 

## Get the code

Execute Git command for cloning: `https://github.com/Sergey-Russiyan/petstore`  
Or simply [download a zip](https://github.com/Sergey-Russiyan/petstore) file.

## Organisational structure

1. Master repo located at [GitHub](https://github.com/Sergey-Russiyan/petstore) its [public]
2. [GitLab group](https://gitlab.com/pet-store-fans/pet-store) are mirroring report from p.1 its [public] 
3. At [GitHub pages](https://sergey-russiyan.github.io/petstore/) hosted all related documentation and test results


## The petstore project
The best place to start with Serenity and Cucumber is to clone or download the  project on Github ([https://github.com/](https://github.com/)). 
This project allows you to create run and analyze test scenarios for testing API end-points of 
[https://petstore.swagger.io/](https://petstore.swagger.io/).
The project uses `Cucumber` for BDD scenarios, `RestAssured` library 
for creating *Requests* and `Serenity` framework as Test runner and reports generator. 
As CI - was configured group at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/petstorefans/petstore)
For every information related to CI (test runner config, adding as `maintainer` of code repository etc) please email to 
[sergey.russiyan@gmail.com](sergey.russiyan@gmail.com) 
Test documentation and results will be hosted at: **[Github.io pages](https://sergey-russiyan.github.io/petstore/)**

### The project directory structure
The project has build scripts for both Maven and Gradle, and follows the standard directory structure used in most Serenity projects:
```Gherkin
src
  + docs                                  Screenshots for README etc.
  + main     
  + test
    + java                                Test runners and supporting code
    + resources
      + features                          Feature filesâ€¨
          + pet
             check_delete_pet.feature
             ...
          + store
             check_get_store_inventory.feature
             ... 
          + user
             check_delete_user.feature
             ...        
```

### Adding the Cucumber 4 dependency
Serenity seamlessly supports both Cucumber 2.x and Cucumber 4. 
However, this flexibility requires a little tweaking in the build dependencies.

If you are using Maven, you need to do the following:
- exclude the default `cucumber-core` dependency from your `serenity-core` dependency
- Replace your `serenity-cucumber` dependency with the `serenity-cucumber4` dependency
- Add dependencies on the Cucumber 4.x version of `cucumber-java` and `cucumber-junit` into your project

An example of the correctly configured dependencies is shown below:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.serenity-bdd</groupId>
    <artifactId>serenity-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.38</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
            <artifactId>cucumber-core</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.serenity-bdd</groupId>
    <artifactId>serenity-cucumber4</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.4</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
    <version>4.2.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you want to switch to Gradle instead Maven, you need to ensure that the 4.x version of `cucumber-core` is used using the _resolutionStrategy_ element, and also add the Cucumber 4.x version of `cucumber-java` and `cucumber-junit` dependencies as mentioned above:
```Gradle
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
        force "io.cucumber:cucumber-core:4.2.0"
    }
}

dependencies {
    testCompile "net.serenity-bdd:serenity-core:2.0.38",
                "net.serenity-bdd:serenity-cucumber4:1.0.4",
                "io.cucumber:cucumber-core:4.2.0",
                "io.cucumber:cucumber-junit:4.2.0"
}
```

## A simple GET scenario
The project comes with few simple scenarios, 

 scenario exercises the `/api/` endpoint
Both variations of the sample project uses the sample Cucumber scenario. 

```Gherkin
 Feature: Check on inventory status
 
  The `/store/inventory` end point returns inventory .
 
   Scenario: Application inventory end-point
     Given the application is running
     When I check the store inventory
     Then the API should return valid JSON

```

The glue code for this scenario illustrates the layered approach we find works
well for both web and non-web acceptance tests.
The glue code is responsible for orchestrating calls to a layer of 
more business-focused classes, which perform the actual REST calls.

```java
    @Steps
    Application theApplication;

    @Given("the application is running")
    public void the_application_is_running() {
        assertThat(theApplication.currentStatus()).isEqualTo(RUNNING);
    }

    @When("I check the application status")
    public void i_check_the_application_status() {
        theApplication.readStatusMessage();
    }
```

The actual REST calls are performed using RestAssured in the action classes,
 like `Application` here. 
These use either RestAssured (if we don't want the queries to appear in the reports)
 or SerenityRest (if we do):

```java
public class Application {

    public AppStatus currentStatus() {
        int statusCode = RestAssured.get(STATUS.getUrl()).statusCode();
        return (statusCode == 200) ? AppStatus.RUNNING : AppStatus.DOWN;
    }

    @Step("Get current status message")
    public void readStatusMessage() {
        SerenityRest.get(STATUS.getUrl());
    }
}
```

In steps that perform assertions, we can also use the `SerenityRest.restAssuredThat()` helper method, 
which lets us make a RestAssured assertion on the last response the server sent us:

```java

    @Then("the API should return {string}")
    public void the_API_should_return(String expectedMessage) {
        restAssuredThat(lastResponse -> lastResponse.body(equalTo(expectedMessage)));
    }
```
## Run tests locally
**Prerequisites (for Windows)**
 1. [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed and 
 [configured](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/821-0917/inst_jdk_javahome_t/index.html);
 2. [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed and [configured](https://mkyong.com/maven/how-to-install-maven-in-windows/);
 3. IDE (e.g. [IntelliJ IDEA 'Community edition'](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)) installed and configured;
   
 ***Optional***
 1. [Github](https://github.com/) account created;
 2. [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) account created;
 
 Open IDE terminal ([Ctr]+[F12]) and run maven command `mvn clean verify`.
 Thus - all scenarios located under `features` folder will be executed.
 NOTE: you may exclude some scenarios from test run, for example affected by exiting bug/issue
 by placing `@issue` annotation above `Scenario` word.
 ```Gerkin
@issue
  Scenario: Application delete pet
    Given the application is running
    When I delete pet with id "555"
    Then the API should return response with status code 200
 ```
Available annotations or tags may be enumerated in `CucumberTestSuite` class
see `tags = "~@issue"` - to exclude all scenarios with such tag from test run
and `tags = "@issue"` (without *tilda* ~ symbol) to include
 ```java
@CucumberOptions(
        tags = "~@issue",
        plugin = {"pretty"},
        features = "classpath:features")
public class CucumberTestSuite {
}
 ```

## Run tests at CI

Currently CI at Gitlab run whole suite each time when commit has been made at Github and
Gitlab sync with main repo.
You can download zipped test results at [Gitlab Jobs URL](https://gitlab.com/pet-store-fans/pet-store/-/jobs)
![](src/docs/artifact_ci_location.png)  

Please note to download click at [artifacts] button/icon related to `test` **stage** and **name** !

TODO Point of improvement - publish test report at github pages per build.

## Living documentation

You can generate full Serenity reports by running `mvn clean verify`. 
This includes both the living documentation from the feature files.  

Report will be available at `src\target\site\serenity\index.html` file.
